*    A collection of numerical functions designed to facilitate a wide          *
*    range of numerical programming as required by C9X.                         *
*                                                                               *
*    The <fp.h> declares many functions in support of numerical programming.    *
*    It provides a superset of <math.h> and <SANE.h> functions.  Some           *

*    can be found in this <fp.h> under the heading "__NOEXTENSIONS__".          *

*    All of these functions are IEEE 754 aware and treat exceptions, NaNs,      *
*    positive and negative zero and infinity consistent with the floating-      *
*    point standard.                                                            *

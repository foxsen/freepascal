 { The subject matter of the test is heaptrc checking pointers belonging to .data
   or .bss sections. However, using a standard io file for this purpose is not a good
   idea, because it is a threadvar and resides in .bss only in certain circumstances
   (FPC-specific threadvar model and multithreading not initialized).
   Using a 'normal' file is fine. }

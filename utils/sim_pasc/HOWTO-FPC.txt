To compare a body of suspect code with pre-existing code, use the following
command (after performing a make to build the tool)

./sim_pasc -eS -w 170 suspectfile1  suspectfileN / orgfile1 ... orgfileM

You can obviously use wild cards. The number after "-w" indicates how
many columns will be used in the output (best make it > 160 to avoid too
much wrapping)

SIM tests lexical similarity in texts in C, Java, Pascal, Modula-2, Lisp,
Miranda and natural language. It can be used

- to detect potentially duplicated code fragments in large software projects,
- to detect plagiarism in software and text-based projects, educational and
  otherwise.

The program is fast:
the UNIX version on a Sun ULTRA does about 50000 tokens/sec,
the DOS version on a Pentium 166 does about 25000 tokens/sec.

SIM is available for UNIX (in source code) and MSDOS (32-bit executables).

UNIX:
	To obtain the files, do:
		sh sim_2_21.shar
	This unpacks the sources, the Makefile, sim.1 and READ_ME.
	For installation notes and other info then see READ_ME.

MSDOS:
	To obtain the files, do:
		[pk]unzip SIM_2_21.zip
	This unpacks the executables, SIM.DOC and READ.ME.
	For other info then see READ.ME.

Changes from Release 2.19:
	Various changes necessitated by Linux flex being different

Changes from Release 2.16:
	Various updates and adjustments in the code and the installation
	procedure.

Changes from Release 2.13:
	Percentage reporting feature added.

Changes from Release 2.12:
	Miranda checker added.

Changes from Release 2.9:
	Java checker added.
	The C checker 'sim' was renamed to 'sim_c', for uniformity.
	Converted the sources to ANSI C.
	All versions now report non_ASCI characters in the input.

Changes from Release 2.8:
	DOS versions can now compare very large files (>400000 tokens)

Changes from Release 1.21, as posted in comp.sources.unix (1987):
	Ported to MSDOS
	Significant speed improvements
	New options: -e, -S and / , to compare files group-wise
	New option: -F , to require function names to match exactly
	Lisp version added
	Miscellaneous improvements
